        The purpose of the Game is to identify SETs of 3 cards from the 12
        unique cards shown on the board. You have 90 seconds to find as many as
        you can!
      </h3>

      <h2>What is a Set?</h2>
      <h3>
        A set consists of three cards in which each feature (shape, color,
        number and fill) are all the same, or all different.

        Once you think youâ€™ve found a set, click on the cards. If it is a set,
        the selected cards will turn green, a +1 will be added to your score,
        and the three cards will be replaced by new cards. If it is not a set,
        the cards will turn red and your score will decrease by 1.

# SET

## What does the project do?

This project implements the card game SET in a full-stack web application. The application allows users to play the game as a single player and (eventually) against other players online.
What is the purpose of the project?

To provide users with a convenient, interactive and enjoyable gameplay experience of the card game SET, while implementing both front and backend skills such as:

Front-end: The frontend of the application is responsible for rendering the game's user interface. It includes elements such as the game board, cards, and user controls (e.g., buttons for selecting cards). The UI should be intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive to user interactions.

Back-end: The backend of the application contains the game logic. It manages the rules of the Set card game, including card shuffling, dealing, and verifying valid sets. It also keeps track of players' scores, time limits, and any additional game features.
